Slide and Inheritance
=====================

If no content element is found by the select command, the rootLine will be traversed back until some content is found.

This is the behaviour of the backend layouts of the EXT:start by default.

You can disabel this property by the Constant Editor. See

* [START - VIEW - BE_LAYOUT - SLIDE]
