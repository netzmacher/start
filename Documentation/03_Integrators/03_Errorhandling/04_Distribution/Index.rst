Distribution 
============


Doesn't run proper
------------------

Some times the distribution isn't running proper.

Problem: you don't get any prompt.

Do this:

* Try to activate the distribution (i.e: Launch TYPO3 GRUENE!) by the extension-manager [Installed extensions]

Be happy, if you get a prompt with an error message now.
Maybe you know, what to do now.
