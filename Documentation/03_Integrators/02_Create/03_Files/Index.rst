Files
=====

* Files can named without any restriction.

* The file name will get an unique id while the migration.
  This avoid any file-name conflict and enables the canceling of the launch.

* Files should be stored in the same directory tree like they should installed.

XML
---

Files must be registered in the tables of the FAL, the File Abstraction Layer.

See 

* sys_file.xml

* sys_file_metadata.xml

* sys_file_reference.xml and 

* sys_file_storage.xml

in the section above :ref:`Database <integrators-create-database>`
