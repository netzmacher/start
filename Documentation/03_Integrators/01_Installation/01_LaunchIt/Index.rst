Launch it!
==========

Please install Start TYPO3 Responsive! with Launch TYPO3 Responsive!
You will get a ready-to-use website with sample pages, data and themes.

You can install it in an empty TYPO3 installation and you can install it in 
TYPO3 installations, which contains websites.

This launch runs with TYPO3 6.x, 7.x and 8.x.

See the workflow at :ref:`Screenshots > Launch it! <introduction-screenshots-launchit>`

You can test the launch at http://start-typo3-responsive.de?18991

Alternatives
------------

If you like a responsive website extended with a database for the lobbies and the organisers,
you can use the TYPO3 distribution "Launch TYPO3 Gruene!" (launchstartgreen).

TYPO3 Gruene can manage events, locations and news among others. To get rid of the corporate design
of the German party Bündnis 90/Die Grünen you have only to replace TYPO3 GRÜNE (startgreen) with 
Start TYPO3 Responsive +Customer (startcustomer) after the installation.

Because this website is a teamplay with a lot of extensions, it runs with TYPO3 7.x only.

See details about TYPO3 Gruene at http://typo3-gruene.de
