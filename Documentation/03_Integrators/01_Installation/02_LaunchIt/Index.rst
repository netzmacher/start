Launch it!
==========

There is a TYPO3 distribution "Launch TYPO3 Grüne!" (launchstartgreen), 
which enables you to launch Start TYPO3 Responsive ready-to-use with a lot of sample data.

Advantage
----------

- You have a whole website with a lot of sample data out-of-the-box with a minimum of effort

- After the installation you need only to replace TYPO3 GRÜNE (startgreen) with Start TYPO3 Responsive +Customer (startcustomer)
  to play with your individual design

- You have the Organiser - responsive TYPO3 for the Lobby and the Organisers - integrated

- You can test the launch live at http://typo3-gruene.de/installation/ausprobieren/

Disadvantage
------------

- If you don't need the Organiser, you have a lot of data only for the trash

Workflow
--------

- Install the distribution Launch TYPO3 GRÜNE! (launchstartgreen)

- Start the installation. See details at: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/launchstartgreen/03_Integrators/01_Launch/
