==========

Grid Elements
'''''''''''''

* Accordions and tabs can now represent any content element. And they can be nested with themselves.
  Until now, only the text element for accordions and tabs was possible.

* Grid elements have ID labels instead of uids, are ready to use and no longer require 
  configuration records in the database.

**BUT YOU SHOULD UPGRADE RECORS IN YOUR DATABASE**: See section 

* :ref:`Upgrades > EXT:start > 6.0 > Grid Elements <upgrades_start_6000000_gridelements>`
