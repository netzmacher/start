Styling
=======

Start works with several so called defined CSS classes.

You enable  these defined classes in the user interface of a content element. See illustration below.

You can controll design properties like:

- Background color

- Font color

- Hyphenation

- Images

  - as circles

  - with shadow

- Margins

- Shadow of content elements

- Text alignment

If you are using an extension of the start family like startgreen, you will get further classes.
