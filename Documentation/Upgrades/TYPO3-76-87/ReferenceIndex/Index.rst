Reference Index
===============

Maybe the upgrade of the reference index isn't run proper.

Probably the cause are "broken" links: **the internal syntax of TYPO3 for links is changed.**

The manual of the Organiser (EXT:org) provides some SQL statements for analysing trouble with the link syntax.

Please refer to
