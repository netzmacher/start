Gridelements
============

Gridelements got the new properties in EXT:start version 5.3.0:

* CSS classes for columns

* Same height for all columns

If you like to use the new features, you must update the XML-code for the gridelements flexforms.


Workflow
--------

Look for the folder, where the layouts of the gridelements are stored. Usually a folder
named "Layouts" in your page tree.

Copy the code from below into the field "Content Element Configuration: Flexform Configuration"
at the tab [Configuration].

That's all.

Sorry for the trouble.
